# Directory templates for Data Science projects

## Why?
It is important to structure your data science project based on a certain standard so that your teammates can easily maintain and modify your project.

This repository provides a template that incorporates best practices to create a maintainable and reproducible data science project.

## How are the templates organized?

The templates are organized in different branches, where each template is expected to be used along with a pre-determined set of tools. Depending on your approach (e.g., whether you want to use a cloud-based or on-premise ML project), you might want to use one template over others. In any case, the directory structure should not vary drastically.

## About this approach

The `aws-sagemaker` branch provides to you a directory structure to work with the Amazon SageMaker, an end-to-end cloud-based ML framework offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The following tools are expected to be used:

| Functionality  | Tool | Comments | Links |
|   ---               |        ---   |     ---   | --- |
| Package management |   Poetry | | [🔗](https://mathdatasimplified.com/poetry-a-better-way-to-manage-python-dependencies) [🔗](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-effortlessly-publish-your-python-package-to-pypi-using-poetry-44b305362f9f) |
